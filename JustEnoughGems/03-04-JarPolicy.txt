For JustEnoughGems version 0.3 and 0.4 JARs are distributed in two categories:

- Normal. Weigh small (<500KB), but require necessary dependencies to be installed
- Standalone. Weigh heavier (>6MB), have all dependencies bundled and set up already. No extra steps needed

Standalone builds are marked with the "s" suffix after the JAR name. For example: justenoughgems-0.3s.jar

Other generated files (-dev, -sources, -sources-dev) are also distributed for standalone builds.
