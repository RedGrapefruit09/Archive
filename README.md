## Downloading files

Since this repository weighs **over 1GB**, it isn't recommended to clone it to download some file.

Instead, use this method:

- Navigate through the repository from GitHub
- Go to the folder with your file of choice
- Click on that file's label
- Click on the _Raw_ button. The file should start downloading, if not, confirm a dialogue in Firefox or, if the file appears as plain text, click _Ctrl+S_ to manually save it
